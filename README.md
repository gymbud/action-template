# TypeScript!
This repository serves as a base for any action you might want to create using typescript.
To start your new action, do the following :

- run `git remote update origin <your/git/repo.git>`
- run `npm i` or `yarn`, depending on your preferences

And that's it, you're done! Here's how it works. This repo is configured to run `prettier` and `ncc` 
on every commit. This way, your code is always formatted and built as a single `index.js` file, 
and you don't need to remember to do it yourself!
